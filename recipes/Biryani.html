        <u>Steps</u>
        <li>
            Fry the Onions
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.
        </li>
